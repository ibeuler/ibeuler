## Hi there 👋

I am a **double major student** at **Istanbul University**, pursuing degrees in **Physics** and **Computer Science**. My academic interests bridge the worlds of theoretical physics and computational problem-solving. 🌌💻 

### About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on physics experiments, data analysis, and Python-based analysis.
- 🌱 I’m always learning more about advanced topics in physics, machine learning, and quantum computing.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to scientific computing and AI.
<!-- - 🤔 I’m looking for help with integrating physics models into real-world applications using computational tools. -->
- 💬 Ask me about physics, programming, or how to juggle two majors!
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email](mailto:ibohamed27@gmail.com) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-abu-shawish-26798a1bb/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My nickname, **ibeuler**, is inspired by my name and the mathematician Euler (plus, I’m a bit of a night owl! 🦉).

### Skills
- **Tools & Technologies:** LaTeX, Matplotlib, NumPy, TensorFlow
- **Interests:** Quantum mechanics, numerical methods, machine learning, algorithm optimization...

### Goals
- 🧑‍🎓 Graduate with a strong foundation in both majors and apply my knowledge to cutting-edge research.
- 🌐 Contribute to projects that make science and technology accessible and impactful.
- 🚀 Work on interdisciplinary solutions blending physics, computer science, and AI.
